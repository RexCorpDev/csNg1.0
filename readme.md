# Shaping Up With Angular.js Practice App

[Code School](http://codeschool.com/) course on [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/).

## Description

This is a practice app for exploring angular workflows. All images are copyright of codeschool.com and used with their permission.  

## Reminder
To display angular functionality properly you'll need to run "python -m httpSimpleServer" within the root dir. This is required when using custom directive references.

### Post Course Notes
- CSS colors for nav pills would not properly color.
- Small thumbnails do not change main image when clicked as per the cloned repo.  Course did contradicted this functionality by placing the changes inside a "galleryController", then in the videos having that controller removed when creating a "productGallery" custom directive.  
- Centering the entire list-group isn't working. Need to find a fix.
